        Atomic Habits - Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results
      </h2>
      <p class="text-start text-center">
        No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for
        improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on
        habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you
        exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny
        behaviors that lead to remarkable results. <br /><br />
        If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you.
        The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again
        not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong
        system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall
        to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can
        take you to new heights. <br /><br />
        Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple
        behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he
        draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and
        neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good
        habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will
        be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold
        medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving
        physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits
        to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. <br /><br />
        Learn how to: make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);
        overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; design your environment to
        make success easier; get back on track when you fall off course; ...and
        much more. <br /><br />
        Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success,
        and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your
        habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an
        organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who
        wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other
        goal.
